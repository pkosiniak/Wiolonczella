This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Explanation

*This was my first steps into React world - the branch called 'old' - especially. Branch 'application-rebuild' was made with experience gained during 3-month internship in x-kom and it's now the 'master' brunch.*<br>
*This project is far from perfect though and it's not finished in my opinion either, but considering amount of time I would have to spent to fix all issues, the fact that it was supposed to be simple single-short-advertise page made for a client and stability of the 'old' version, the project it's not worth further development right now. Maybe I will publish on server the new version in the next future, but right now it stays as it is.*


### Things that should be done:

* Complete dispose of SASS in favor of styled-components,
* Some components needs to be strongly refactored using more of different lifecycle methods,
* Write some tests,
* Few more features like scroll-spy,
* Some minor fixes,
* npm audit fix should be done to mitigate vulnerabilities.

#### Note for recruiters
If You are recruiter, note that this project was made in 2019 and it was my first steps in React world, although it has some quite nice hacks.
